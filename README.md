## includes package list

This package list file can be used to install packages using:
```
apm install --packages-file package-list.txt
```

Package list files can be generated using:
```
apm list --installed --bare > package-list.txt
```

It is recommended that for csv or other 'seperated values' file type to use tablr. Tablr has a few problems in current atom as it has not been updated. However a fork which now works is availiable using:
```
apm install https://github.com/mfripp/atom-tablr.git
```
